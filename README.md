# NSGA-II with Comet Integration for ZDT2 Problem

This repository implements the **Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II)** to solve the ZDT2 multi-objective optimization problem. The project includes integration with [Comet](https://www.comet.com/) for tracking experiments, metrics, and visualizations.

---

## üìã Features

- Implementation of **NSGA-II** for multi-objective optimization.
- Solving the **ZDT2 problem** and **Comet Problem** with its non-convex Pareto front.
- Easy-to-use modular code structure for customization.

---

## üß∞ Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rikunz/NSGA-IIgit
cd NSGA-II
```


### Run the Code

```bash
python comet.py
```

This will execute the NSGA-II algorithm on the ZDT2 problem and log the experiment results to Comet.
